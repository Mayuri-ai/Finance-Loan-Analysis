Loan Portfolio Analytics Dashboard | Financial Performance Insights (Power BI)
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor loan distribution, repayment performance, and borrower characteristics—helping financial institutions gain deeper insights into portfolio health and lending trends.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Loan Portfolio Dashboard provides a 360° view of loan performance across multiple parameters such as total loans, installments, income, payments, and loan status. It enables financial analysts and credit managers to track key metrics, assess borrower risk profiles, and identify trends in loan disbursement and repayment.

3. Tech Stack

This dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• Power BI Desktop – For creating visuals and interactive dashboards.
• Power Query Editor – For cleaning, transforming, and merging raw financial data.
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculating KPIs like total loan amount, installments, and payments by status and term.
• Data Modeling – Relationships defined between borrower, loan, and installment tables to support drill-through and cross-filtering.
• File Format – .pbix (Power BI report file) and .png for presentation preview.

4. Data Source

Source: Loan and customer financial dataset (sample financial lending data).
It includes:

Borrower details (employment length, verification status)

Loan attributes (amount, term, purpose, issue date)

Payment performance (installments, total payments, loan status)

Financial metrics (annual income, charged-off and fully paid records)

The dataset was structured in Power Query and enriched using DAX for aggregated insights by term, purpose, and loan status.
